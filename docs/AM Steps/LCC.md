Paris, France and New York City, United States of America - Reinventing assets
The Coulée Verte in Paris and the High Line in New York City showcase the transformative power of reinventing underutilized infrastructure. The [Coulée Verte](https://parissecret.com/decouvrez-lhistoire-de-la-coulee-verte-la-promenade-vegetale-de-paris/), an elevated urban garden built on an unused railway line, was established as a green lung for the city in 1993. This former railway line, dating back to 1859, became an inspiration for similar projects around the globe, proving that obsolete infrastructure could be reinvented for the public good, at a lower cost than demolition and revitalizing surrounding neighbourhoods. 
Following Paris's example, New York City transformed the decaying [High Line](https://edc.nyc/project/high-line) railway into an elevated park that revitalized the Chelsea neighborhood. Previously destined for demolition, two residents advocated for the High Line's conversion by citing the success of the Coulée Verte. Opening in 2009, the High Line became a pivotal asset in urban regeneration, enhancing the real estate value in its vicinity and becoming a famous tourist attraction. Similar projects have subsequently sprung up in cities like Philadelphia, Chicago, and Atlanta. Together, these projects highlight the potential of adaptive reuse in sustainable asset management.
