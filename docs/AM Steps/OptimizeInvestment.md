Vancouver, Canada – Collaborative Infrastructure Governance 
Vancouver's [collaborative infrastructure governance model](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/05/vancouver-cities-develop-better-infrastructure-planning-development/) has recently stood out as a powerful approach to infrastructure planning and development. The city, facing challenges of affordability, rapid growth, climate resilience, and citizen well-being, adopted an innovative model that promotes multi-layered cooperation across various government departments. This was not a rapid, one-time change, but rather a long-term effort requiring consistent commitment and active engagement from all parties. The model fostered improved dialogue through director meetings, ensured transparency around priorities, and fostered strategic alignment across departments. Collaborative governance was developed through the following steps: integrating city-level priorities into departmental plans via a "layered" system, connecting departments to ensure consistency and coordination, incentivizing “win-win” models for jointly funded projects, focusing on outcome-driven project delivery, and instilling a culture that is flexible and responsive to stakeholder feedback. 
An example of the model’s application is the "One Water Approach," an integrated infrastructure plan that emphasizes cross-departmental collaboration for water and watershed-related services. All planning, budgeting, and maintenance tasks are shared between stakeholders, with no single agency at the center of the process. Instead, the needs of the utility and all levels of government take precedence. The success of this model can be seen in the Alberta Street Blue Green System, a project that impacted pedestrian mobility, green space, sewage, wastewater, stormwater, broadband, and public space quality. This case underscores the transformative potential of aligning asset management and urban planning in enhancing urban sustainability and resilience.
