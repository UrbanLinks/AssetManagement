# 7.Optimized O&M and Capital Investment Strategies

## Optimization 

In simple terms, optimization involves methods that aim to improve outcomes to the greatest extent possible. In infrastructure management, optimization techniques are primarily used to allocate capital or operations and maintenance (O&M) budgets efficiently, with the goal of improving levels of service.

An optimization problem consists of objectives, constraints, and decision variables. Objectives could include minimizing costs, minimizing risks, or maximizing asset condition. Constraints may encompass budget limitations, regulatory requirements, or minimum levels of service. Decision variables represent the elements the optimization process will adjust to achieve the defined objectives within the constraints—such as selecting assets for replacement or rehabilitation. These examples are not exhaustive; asset managers must tailor the optimization problem to reflect the unique characteristics and available data of their system. For instance, in some cases, levels of service might be considered as constraints, while in others they might be the main objective.

Multiple objectives can also be defined, but to identify the best overall solution, these objectives should be weighted, allowing for a single composite objective to guide the decision-making process. Consider the example of optimizing a capital budget by selecting assets for replacement. If there is only one objective—minimizing risk within a fixed budget—the assets with the highest risk scores would be prioritized for replacement until the budget is exhausted. If the objectives are dual (e.g., minimizing both risk and cost), various combinations of asset replacements would need to be tested, with the resulting risk and cost outcomes of each scenario compared. To select the optimal solution, an overall score could be computed by assigning weights to risk and cost. A useful approach here is to determine the Pareto front, which represents the set of best risk-cost combinations where any improvement in one objective would lead to a compromise in the other. Ultimately, the organization would select a point on the Pareto front, thereby implicitly prioritizing risk versus cost according to its goals

## Prioritization and Optimization Approaches

Prioritization and optimization methods in asset management range from simple subjective rankings to advanced mathematical models, each with its own advantages and limitations. The simplest approach is a subjective ranking based on judgment, which, while quick and easy, is highly susceptible to bias and may not yield optimal results. Ranking methods based on specific parameters, such as levels of service or asset condition, are also straightforward and user-friendly but may still fall short of optimal solutions. Adding economic analysis or risk assessment to parameter-based rankings provides a slightly more refined approach that is reasonably simple while bringing results closer to optimal.

Mathematical programming models used for optimization are more complex but can yield near-optimal solutions. These models can optimize budgets on a year-by-year basis, though they often overlook the timing of interventions. Comprehensive optimization, which uses mathematical programming to determine the best combination of interventions based on "which assets, what actions, and when," is the most complex approach but can yield highly optimized programs that balance maximizing benefits with minimizing costs.

Advanced computational techniques such as genetic algorithms offer alternative methods for complex optimization problems. Genetic algorithms are widely used as heuristic search tools that can explore numerous combinations to approach an optimal solution. Overall, while simpler methods are easier to apply and interpret, more sophisticated optimization approaches can offer substantial benefits by providing cost-effective and strategic asset management solutions.

## Capital investment strategies

Capital investment refers to either asset replacement or rehabilitation. Replacement involves substituting an existing asset, which could be a like-for-like swap or an upgrade that improves the level of service. For example, replacing an outdated piece of equipment with a more efficient model, or installing a higher-capacity asset to meet growing demand, aligns with goals of enhancing service or adapting to new standards.  When setting up capital investment optimization, budgets are often defined as a constraint, dictating the extent of feasible improvements within a given fiscal period. 

Because capital projects are generally large-scale, as compared to regular maintenance, it is more effective to analyze the asset systems together rather than in isolation. Coordinated investment strategies, often referred to as corridor replacements, allow for synchronized planning of adjacent assets, such as roads, water mains, and sewer lines. This approach reduces costs, especially for traditional open cut pipe replacement, and also minimizes disruptions to the community.

Today, a wide range of software solutions are available that integrate data from various asset systems, perform the necessary optimization, and provide a prioritized list of capital projects. These tools streamline decision-making and for this reason are known as "Decision Support Systems".

Vancouver, Canada – Collaborative Infrastructure Governance 
Vancouver's [collaborative infrastructure governance model](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/05/vancouver-cities-develop-better-infrastructure-planning-development/) has recently stood out as a powerful approach to infrastructure planning and development. The city, facing challenges of affordability, rapid growth, climate resilience, and citizen well-being, adopted an innovative model that promotes multi-layered cooperation across various government departments. This was not a rapid, one-time change, but rather a long-term effort requiring consistent commitment and active engagement from all parties. The model fostered improved dialogue through director meetings, ensured transparency around priorities, and fostered strategic alignment across departments. Collaborative governance was developed through the following steps: integrating city-level priorities into departmental plans via a "layered" system, connecting departments to ensure consistency and coordination, incentivizing “win-win” models for jointly funded projects, focusing on outcome-driven project delivery, and instilling a culture that is flexible and responsive to stakeholder feedback. 
An example of the model’s application is the "One Water Approach," an integrated infrastructure plan that emphasizes cross-departmental collaboration for water and watershed-related services. All planning, budgeting, and maintenance tasks are shared between stakeholders, with no single agency at the center of the process. Instead, the needs of the utility and all levels of government take precedence. The success of this model can be seen in the Alberta Street Blue Green System, a project that impacted pedestrian mobility, green space, sewage, wastewater, stormwater, broadband, and public space quality. This case underscores the transformative potential of aligning asset management and urban planning in enhancing urban sustainability and resilience.
