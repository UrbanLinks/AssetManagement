# 5. Set Target LOS

## Level of Service

Levels of service (LoS) are defined by the [ISO 55001](https://www.iso.org/standard/83054.html) as “parameters, or combination of parameters, which reflect social, political, environmental and economic outcomes that the organization delivers". For infrastructure assets, LoS are typically defined for each asset system. Essentially they represent the goals of these systems.

LoS can be defined by different stakeholders. **Customer LoS** represent the expectations of the customer, communicated in broad tangible terms, e.g. reliability, safety, efficiency, capacity. **Technical LoS** are the operationalization of these broader expectations in technical terms, e.g. pavement condition, water quality. 

Each technical LoS should be related to a performance measure, e.g. pavement IRI, number of boil water advisories. These performance measures should be measured regularly so that a current LoS can be established, and based on this a goal, i.e. expected LoS can also be set.

Each expected LoS should be **SMART**:
- **Specific**: Clearly defined and focused on a particular outcome.
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable so that progress toward the goal can be tracked.
- **Attainable**: Realistic and achievable within the organization's capacity and resources.
- **Relevant**: Aligned with broader organizational or stakeholder goals.
- **Time-based**: Set within a clear timeframe to provide accountability and milestones.

For example, an expected level of service could be to reduce the rate of water main breaks by 10% in breaks/km/year over the next five years.

Existing infrastructure benchmarking initiatives can provide insights for defining these levels of service and performance measures. For example, the [Canadian Infrastructure Benchmarking Initiative](https://nationalbenchmarking.com/) sets the following goals for water systems:
- Provide reliable service and infrastructure
- Ensure adequate capacity
- Meet service requirements with economic efficiency
- Protect the environment
- Provide a safe and productive workplace
- Have satisfied and informed customers
- Protect publich health and safety

Similarly, for roads, they define the following goals:
- Reliable road network
- Manage customer expectations
- Optimize the transportation system condition
- Protect the environment
- Provide a financially sustainable transportation system
- Provide a mobile and accessible transportation system
- Provide a safe transportation system
- Provide a safe workplace and a productive workforce

Multiple technical levels of service and related performance measures could be established under each of these goals.

Take the road example for instance, the following set of LoS could be established:
- Customer LoS: optimal condition
- Technical LoS: pavement roughness
- Performance Measure: average IRI
In this case the current LoS would be the IRI for the current year, and the expected LoS would be the IRI expected to be achieved by the end of the period planned in the asset management plan (e.g. 5 years). For any expected LoS that is an improvement on current LoS it is imperative that an improvement strategy is defined. In this example, the strategy would be related to how IRI could be improved, such as by increasing rehabilitation on critical roads.

:::info Case Study: Medellín, Colombia – Increasing Level of Service for Equity
Medellín, Colombia, serves as a compelling case study of urban development promoting equity. In the mid 90s, following the disintegration of local drug cartels, the city still had extremely high crime rates, driven by social inequities. The city adopted a territorial plan in 1999 with a focus on both urban and rural development. The plan proposed improved transportation access for communities, as well as increased public lighting, new pedestrian bridges and paths, "library parks", new school and recreational center buildings and more police patrols. A key part of this plan involved the installation of a cable-propelled transit system, Metrocable, which drastically improved [transportation access for disadvantaged communities](https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/04/25/half-a-miracle/) situated on the city's steep hills. 
A comparison of the evolution of violence in neighborhoods with and without the infrastructure improvements between 2003 and 2012, found the homicide rate dropped by 84% in neighbourhoods connected by Metrocable compared to 60% in areas not connected. The belief in collective efficacy, trust in the criminal justice system and reliance on the police also saw more significant increases in the connected group. The [research](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/175/10/1045/89012) suggests that large-scale investment in neighborhood infrastructure, such as increasing the level of service of public transit in Medellín, can be linked to a more equitable urban future.
