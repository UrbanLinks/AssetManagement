Medellín, Colombia – Increasing Level of Service for Equity
Medellín, Colombia, serves as a compelling case study of urban development promoting equity. In the mid 90s, following the disintegration of local drug cartels, the city still had extremely high crime rates, driven by social inequities. The city adopted a territorial plan in 1999 with a focus on both urban and rural development. The plan proposed improved transportation access for communities, as well as increased public lighting, new pedestrian bridges and paths, "library parks", new school and recreational center buildings and more police patrols. A key part of this plan involved the installation of a cable-propelled transit system, Metrocable, which drastically improved [transportation access for disadvantaged communities](https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/04/25/half-a-miracle/) situated on the city's steep hills. 
A comparison of the evolution of violence in neighborhoods with and without the infrastructure improvements between 2003 and 2012, found the homicide rate dropped by 84% in neighbourhoods connected by Metrocable compared to 60% in areas not connected. The belief in collective efficacy, trust in the criminal justice system and reliance on the police also saw more significant increases in the connected group. The [research](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/175/10/1045/89012) suggests that large-scale investment in neighborhood infrastructure, such as increasing the level of service of public transit in Medellín, can be linked to a more equitable urban future.
