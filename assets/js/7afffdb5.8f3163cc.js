Assess Condition","description":"Once assets are identified and located, assessing their condition is essential to planning current and future investment needs. The accuracy and frequency of the condition assessments can also follow a risk-based hierarchy as suggested for the inventory. It is important that decision-makers are aware of the types of assessment techniques, costs, as well as the results and accuracy they provide, as this will shape their applicability. Age can provide an initial estimate of condition. Maintenance and repair records, such as number of breaks or pothole repairs, provide more detailed feedback on specific asset condition. Visual assessment can be a low-cost, however subjective, solution for accessible assets. Methods for more detailed condition assessment will depend on the type of asset. Newer technologies apply artificial intelligence to automatically collect data and rate condition. Examples of assessment techniques, both common place and novel are discussed below.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"AM Steps/BuildPlan":{"id":"AM Steps/BuildPlan","title":"9.
