If the objectives are dual (e.g., minimizing both risk and cost), various combinations of asset replacements would need to be tested, with the resulting risk and cost outcomes of each scenario compared. To select the optimal solution, an overall score could be computed by assigning weights to risk and cost. A useful approach here is to determine the Pareto front, which represents the set of best risk-cost combinations where any improvement in one objective would lead to a compromise in the other.

The city, facing challenges of affordability, rapid growth, climate resilience, and citizen well-being, adopted an innovative model that promotes multi-layered cooperation across various government departments. This was not a rapid, one-time change, but rather a long-term effort requiring consistent commitment and active engagement from all parties. The model fostered improved dialogue through director meetings, ensured transparency around priorities, and fostered strategic alignment across departments. Collaborative governance was developed through the following steps: integrating city-level priorities into departmental plans via a "layered" system, connecting departments to ensure consistency and coordination, incentivizing \u201cwin-win\u201d models for jointly funded projects, focusing on outcome-driven project delivery, and instilling a culture that is flexible and responsive to stakeholder feedback.\nAn example of the model\u2019s application is the "One Water Approach," an integrated infrastructure plan that emphasizes cross-departmental collaboration for water and watershed-related services. All planning, budgeting, and maintenance tasks are shared between stakeholders, with no single agency at the center of the process. Instead, the needs of the utility and all levels of government take precedence. The success of this model can be seen in the Alberta Street Blue Green System, a project that impacted pedestrian mobility, green space, sewage, wastewater, stormwater, broadband, and public space quality. This case underscores the transformative potential of aligning asset management and urban planning in enhancing urban sustainability and resilience.']}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"maintenance-programs",children:"Maintenance Programs"})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,n.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(m,{...e})}):m(e)}},8453:(e,t,i)=>{i.d(t,{R:()=>o,x:()=>r});var a=i(6540);const n={},s=a.createContext(n);function o(e){const t=a.useContext(s);return a.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(n):e.components||n:o(e.components),a.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
