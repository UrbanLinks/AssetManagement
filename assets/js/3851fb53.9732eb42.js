In the mid 90s, following the disintegration of local drug cartels, the city still had extremely high crime rates, driven by social inequities. The city adopted a territorial plan in 1999 with a focus on both urban and rural development. The plan proposed improved transportation access for communities, as well as increased public lighting, new pedestrian bridges and paths, "library parks", new school and recreational center buildings and more police patrols.
