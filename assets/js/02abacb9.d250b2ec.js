Previously destined for demolition, two residents advocated for the High Line's conversion by citing the success of the Coul\xe9e Verte. Opening in 2009, the High Line became a pivotal asset in urban regeneration, enhancing the real estate value in its vicinity and becoming a famous tourist attraction. Similar projects have subsequently sprung up in cities like Philadelphia, Chicago, and Atlanta.
